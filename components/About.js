              I have over <strong>2 years</strong> of experience as a{" "}
              <strong>Web and Mobile App Developer</strong>. My first role was
              as a <strong>Frontend Developer</strong> at Enter Soft Inside,
              where I designed visually appealing web pages and built reusable
              components using <strong>React JS</strong> and{" "}
              <strong>Next JS</strong>. I later took on the role of a{" "}
              <strong>Full Stack Web Developer</strong> at Queenâ€™s College of
              Business Technology & Public Safety, where I worked on updating a
              website and mobile app using <strong>React</strong>,{" "}
              <strong>Express</strong>, and <strong>MongoDB</strong>, while
              integrating <strong>JWT</strong> authentication and managing state
